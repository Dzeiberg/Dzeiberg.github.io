I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, working with Rose Yu. I study machine learning, and am interested in time-series and sequential decision making. I received my Bachelors degree from the University of Michigan where I worked with Jenna Wiens on machine learning methods for health care.
