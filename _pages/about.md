I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, working with Predrag Radivojac. I study machine learning, and am interested in developing deep learning prediction methods for biological and spatiotemporal data. I received my Bachelors degree from the University of Michigan where I worked with Jenna Wiens on machine learning methods for health care.
